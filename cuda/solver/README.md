# cuSolver/LU basic example.

This lesson demonstrates how to use cuSolver/LU to solve a dense A*x=b equation.
Based on the NVIDIA_CUDA-10.0_Samples/7_CUDALibraries/cuSolverDn_LinearSolver sample.
Some refactoring was performed in order to reveal the fundamentals of working with cuSolver and to make this a standalone sample.

## Usage

### Build

$ ./build.sh

### Cleanup

$ ./clean.sh

### Execute sample
